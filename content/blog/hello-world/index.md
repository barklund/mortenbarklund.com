summary: Welcome to my blog - a place for thoughts on React, accessibility and testing.
---

Welcome. So, what's this about? This will be a place where I dump my thoughts and ideas - mostly about React, accessibility and testing, but also other more or less related topics.

I'll post new content at least weekly. Please follow along on [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/barklund) or subscribe to [the newsletter](/newsletter) here - I'll promise to only ping you semimonthly about new content!
